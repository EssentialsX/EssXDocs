# EssentialsX website

Current official website for EssentialsX, including downloads and documentation.

The site uses [Docute v3](https://v3.docute.org/) to serve docs directly from the [EssentialsX wiki](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/wiki).

Download links are retrieved from [Jenkins](https://ci.ender.zone/job/EssentialsX) with [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), and are displayed in-page with a custom Vue component.
